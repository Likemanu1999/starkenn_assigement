Task: Build a TODO application using Node.js and a popular front-end
framework like React, Vue, or Angular. The application should allow
users to create, read, update, and delete TODO items, and persist the
data to a database.

Requirements:
- The application should have a sign-up/sign-in functionality where
users can create an account or log in to an existing account.
Once logged in, users should be able to create TODO items with a title
and a description.
- Users should be able to mark a TODO item as completed, edit the
details of a TODO item, or delete a TODO item.

- The application should display a list of all the TODO items created
by the user, with an option to filter them by status (completed,
active, or all).

- The data should be stored in a database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL,
and accessed using an ORM like Mongoose or Sequelize.
- The application should have error handling and validation for user inputs.

Bonus:
- Allow users to add due dates to their TODO items and sort them by due date.
- Implement a search functionality to search for TODO items based on
their title or description.
- Implement pagination to display a limited number of TODO items per page.
